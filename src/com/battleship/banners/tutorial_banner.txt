Tutorial:

1. The game is played on a 10x10 grid, where each player has their own grid.

2. Each player places a set of ships on their grid in secret.

3. The ships can be placed horizontally or vertically.

4. Players take turns to 'fire' at the opponent's grid by calling out grid coordinates (e.g., A5, B6).

5. The opponent must announce whether the shot hit or missed. In this game, it's done automatically.

6. The goal is to sink all of the opponent's ships by hitting each square they occupy.

7. The first player to sink all of the opponent's ships wins the game.

8. During your turn, enter the coordinates for your shot (e.g., B7).

9. The game board uses '-' to represent water, 'S' for ships, 'H' for hits, and 'M' for misses.

10. Enjoy the game and may the best strategist win!
